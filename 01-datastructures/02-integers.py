print(1)
# This is a comment
# The below code sets a variable to equal a value notice how this variable does not use single quotes
a = 1
b = 2
# We will now print both variables
print(a,b)

# Now lets add two variable together
print(a+b)

# What happens if you try to add a string and an integer
c = '3'
print(a+c)
# You should receive the following error "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'"
